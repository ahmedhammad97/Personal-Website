var author1696 = "Discord", quotes1696 = ["From hence, let fierce contending nations know What dire effects from civil discord flow.","Have always been at daggers-drawing,And one another clapper-clawing.","That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,Arcades ambo, id estâ€”blackguards both.","And Doubt and Discord step 'twixt thine and thee.","And bitter waxed the fray; When they met in the way.","An old affront will stir the heartThrough years of rankling pain."]
