","An idler is a watch that wants both hands;As useless when it goes as when it stands.","Sleepiness and laziness in a man are the beginning of his misfortune.","[M]an when not stimulated by hope or necessity is naturally a lazy animal.","The lazy are always wanting to do something.","There is no such thing as a lazy person; he is either sick or uninspired.","At ease in a world in which my Lord was such a sufferer!","The idle man is the devil's cushion.","Some temptations come to the industrious, but all temptations attack the idle.","Be always employed about some rational thing that the devil find thee not idle."]
