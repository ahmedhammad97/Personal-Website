Caparisons don't become a young woman.","You are not like Cerberus, three gentlemen at once, are you?","The quarrel is a very pretty quarrel as it stands; we should only spoil it by trying to explain it.","You're our enemy; lead the way, and we 'll precede.","There's nothing like being used to a thing.","I own the soft impeachment.","Through all the drama — whether damned or not — Love gilds the scene, and women guide the plot.","I ne'er could any luster seeIn eyes that would not look on me.","I loved him for himself alone.","A bumper of good liquorThan justice, judge, or vicar.","Had I a heart for falsehood framed,I ne'er could injure you.","Conscience has no more to do with gallantry than it has with politics.","Tale-bearers are as bad as the tale-makers.","You had no taste when you married me.","Here is the whole set! a character dead at every word.","I leave my character behind me.","An unforgiving eye, and a damned disinheriting countenance.","It was an amiable weakness.","There is not a passion so strongly rooted in the human heart as envy.","Sheer necessity,—the proper parent of an art so nearly allied to invention.","Egad, I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two!","A practitioner in panegyric, or, to speak more plainly, a professor of the art of puffing.","No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, I hope?","Certainly nothing is unnatural that is not physically impossible.","Where they do agree on the stage, their unanimity is wonderful.","Inconsolable to the minuet in Ariadne.","The Spanish fleet thou canst not see, because—it is not yet in sight!","An oyster may be crossed in love.","I wish, sir, you would practice this without me. I can't stay dying here all night."]
