var author3263 = "James Macpherson", quotes3263 = ["Those who have doubted my veracity have paid a compliment to my genius.","Often does the memory of former times come, like the evening sun, on my soul.","Sorrow, like a cloud on the sun, shades the soul of Clessammor.","The music was like the memory of joys that are past, pleasant and mournful to the soul.","Where art thou, beam of light? Hunters, from the mossy rock, saw ye the blue-eyed fair?","Can I forget that beam of light, the white-handed daughter of kings?","I look down from my height on nationsAnd they become ashes before me.","The gloom of the battle roared.","Hail, Carril of other times! Thy voice is like the harp in the halls of Tura."]
