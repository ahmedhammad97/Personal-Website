It is a shocking habit — destructive to the logical faculty.","I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule.","You know my methods. Apply them.","It is the unofficial force — the Baker Street irregulars.","You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.","As a rule, the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be.","It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes.","I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see.","There is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.","There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.","You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.","It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles.","My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know.","Data! Data! Data! he cried impatiently. I can't make bricks without clay.","I am glad of all details, remarked my friend, whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.","Nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person.","It is more than possible; it is probable.","Any truth is better than indefinite doubt.","Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.","Out of my last 53 cases 49 have been given full credit to the police and the rest to me.","He is the Napoleon of crime.","Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!","There is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you.","Work is the best antidote to sorrow.","There is no prospect of danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you.","What one man can invent another can discover.","It is impossible as I state it, and therefore I must in some respect have stated it wrong.","There can be no question, my dear Watson, of the value of exercise before breakfast.","Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs.","There is so much red tape in these matters.","Come, Watson, come! he cried. The game is afoot. Not a word! Into your clothes and come!","What I know is unofficial; what he knows is official.","Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department.","Only one important thing has happened in the last three days, and that is that nothing has happened.","It is a capital mistake to theorise in advance of the facts.","Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius.","There should be no combination of events for which the wit of man cannot conceive an explanation.","Birdy Edwards is here. I am Birdy Edwards!","There is but one step from the grotesque to the horrible.","There is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear.","Education never ends Watson. It is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last.","Holmes, you are not yourself. A sick man is but a child.","You fidget me beyond endurance. You, a doctor — you are enough to drive a patient into an asylum.","Three days of absolute fast does not improve one's beauty, Watson.","Malingering is a subject upon which I have sometimes thought of writing a monograph.","It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official police force.","I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and inadequate. We will pass that.","I followed you.That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.","Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change.","It may be some fussy, self-important fool; it may be a matter of life or death.","A complex mind. All great criminals have that.","I am not the law, but I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go.","We must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded.","It is simpler to deal direct.","Well, Watson, we can but possess our souls in patience and see what the hour may bring.","We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it we must suspect deception.","We can but try.","Come at once if convenient — if inconvenient come all the same.","That the dog should die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs.","I am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles.","Cut out the poetry, Watson.","Things must be done decently and in order."]
