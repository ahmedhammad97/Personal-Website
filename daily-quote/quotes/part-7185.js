var author7185 = "William Shenstone", quotes7185 = ["Every good poet includes a critic; the reverse will not hold.","A fool and his words are soon parted; a man of genius and his money.","Love is a pleasing but a various clime.","So sweetly she bade me adieu,I thought that she bade me return.","I have found out a gift for my fair;I have found where the wood-pigeons breed.","My banks they are furnishâ€™d with bees,Whose murmur invites one to sleep.","For seldom shall she hear a taleSo sad, so tender, and so true.","Her cap, far whiter than the driven snow,Emblem right meet of decency does yield.","Pun-provoking thyme.","A little bench of heedless bishops here,And there a chancellor in embryo.","There seem near as many people that want passion as want reason.","Prudent men should lock up their motives, giving only their intimates a key.","A man has generally the good or ill qualities which he attributes to mankind.","Necessity may be the mother of lucrative invention, but it is the death of poetical invention."]
