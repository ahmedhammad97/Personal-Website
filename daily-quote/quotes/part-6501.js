var author6501 = "The Dunciad", quotes6501 = ["While pensive poets painful vigils keep,Sleepless themselves to give their readers sleep.","Or where the pictures for the page atone,And Quarles is saved by beauties not his own.","A brain of feathers, and a heart of lead.","But blind to former, as to future Fate,What mortal knows his pre-existent state?","Till Peter's keys some christen'd Jove adorn,And Pan to Moses lends his pagan horn.","To aid our cause, if Heav'n thou can'st not bend,Hell thou shalt move.","A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits.","The Right Divine of Kings to govern wrong.","To happy convents, bosomed deep in vines,Where slumber abbots, purple as their wines.","Led by my hand, he sauntered Europe round,And gathered every vice on Christian ground."]
