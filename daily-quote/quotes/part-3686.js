var author3686 = "John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester", quotes3686 = ["Reason, an Ignis fatuus of the Mind,Which leaves the light of Nature, Sense, behind.","For all Men would be Cowards if they durst:And Honestyâ€™s against all common Sense.","Dead we become the lumber of the world.","There's not a thing on earth that I can name,So foolish, and so false, as common fame.","A merry monarch, scandalous and poor.","For pointed satire I would Buckhurst choose,The best good man with the worst-natured muse.","The clog of all pleasure, the luggage of life,Is the best can be said for a very good wife."]
