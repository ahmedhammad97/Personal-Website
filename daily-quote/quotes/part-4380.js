var author4380 = "Mark Akenside", quotes4380 = ["Youth calls for Pleasure, Pleasure calls for Love.","Seeks painted trifles and fantastic toys,And eagerly pursues imaginary joys.","The man forget not, though in rags he lies,And know the mortal through a crown's disguise.","Pall on her temper, like a twice-told tale.","Such and so various are the tastes of men!","The Providence of heavenTo each allotted state below.","Heaven's all-subduing will,Attempreth every state below.","Than Timoleon's arms require,And Tully's curule chair, and Milton's golden lyre.","Rustic herald of the spring."]
