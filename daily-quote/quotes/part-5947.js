var author5947 = "Samuel Garth", quotes5947 = ["A barren superfluity of words.","Some fell by laudanum, and some by steel,And death in ambush lay in every pill.","Harsh words, though pertinent, uncouth appear:None please the fancy, who offend the ear.","I see the right, and I approve it too,Condemn the wrong, and yet the wrong pursue.","Hard was their lodging, homely was their food;For all their luxury was doing good."]
