(Hays translation)","Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around.","This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole...","The longest-lived and the shortest-lived man, when they come to die, lose one and the same thing.","Remember that all is opinion.","What means all this?","The lot assigned to every man is suited to him, and suits him to itself.","A man should be upright, not kept upright.","But that which is useful is the better.","Respect the faculty that forms thy judgments.","By a tranquil mind I mean nothing else than a mind well ordered.","The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.","Nothing can come out of nothing, any more than a thing can go back to nothing.","Death, like generation, is a secret of Nature.","Death hangs over thee: whilst yet thou livest, whilst thou mayest, be good.","Let your occupations be few, says the sage, if you would lead a tranquil life.","Love the little trade which thou hast learned, and be content therewith.","All is ephemeral â€” fame and the famous as well.","Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.","All that happens is as usual and familiar as the rose in spring and the crop in summer.","That which comes after ever conforms to that which has gone before.","Nothing happens to anyone that he can't endure. (Hays translation)","Live with the gods.","The intelligence of the universe is social.","The controlling Intelligence understands its own nature, and what it does, and whereon it works.","The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.","Reverence the gods, and help men. Short is life.","I consist of a little body and a soul.","What is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee.","How many together with whom I came into the world are already gone out of it.","To a rational being it is the same thing to act according to nature and according to reason.","Be thou erect, or be made erect.","Is any man afraid of change? Why what can take place without change?","If the gods care not for me and for my children, There is a reason for it.","Very little is needed to make a happy life.","The nature of the All moved to make the universe.","You may break your heart, but men will still go on as before.","It is satisfaction to a man to do the proper works of a man.","If thou canst see sharp, look and judge wisely, says the philosopher.","Blot out vain pomp; check impulse; quench appetite; keep reason under its own control.","Things that have a common quality ever quickly seek their kind.","The rottenness of the matter which is the foundation of everything!","Use these rules then, and trouble thyself about nothing else.","Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.","There is no nature which is inferior to art, the arts imitate the nature of things.","And virtue they will curse, speaking harsh words.","Consider that everything is opinion, and opinion is in thy power.","Depart then satisfied, for he also who releases thee is satisfied.","Find time still to be learning somewhat good, and give up being desultory.","No form of Nature is inferior to Art; for the arts merely imitate natural forms."]
