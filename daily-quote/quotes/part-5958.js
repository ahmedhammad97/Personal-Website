His love hath neither brim nor bottom.","Take Christ in with you under your yoke, and let patience have her perfect work.","There is nothing that will make you a Christian indeed, but a taste of the sweetness of Christ.","Christ seeketh your help in your place; give Him your hand.","Welcome, welcome, cross of Christ, if Christ be with it.","How soon would faith freeze without a cross!","Build your nest upon no tree here, for ye see that God hath sold the forest to death.","Grow as a palm-tree on God's Mount Zion; howbeit shaken with winds, yet the root is fast.","If ye never had a sick night and a pained soul for sin, ye have not yet lighted upon Christ.","Make not Christ a liar in distrusting His promise."]
