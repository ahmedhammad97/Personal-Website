There is no beginning. There is only the infinite passion of life.","A created thing is never invented and it is never true: it is always and ever itself.","Experience is what you get while looking for something else.","It's easier to be faithful to a restaurant than it is to a woman.","Money is everywhere but so is poetry. What we lack are the poets.","A good opening and a good ending make for a good film provided they come close together."]
