var author5175 = "Paul of Tarsus", quotes5175 = ["â€œWhy is it considered unbelievable among you that God raises up the dead?","If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.","I died to the law so that I might live for God.","So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.","Who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.","Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."]
