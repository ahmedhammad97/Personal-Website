If you want to see it well, you do not stand in one place.","The sun will shine on those who stand before it shines on those who kneel under them.","When the moon is shining the cripple becomes hungry for a walk.","As a man danced so the drums were beaten for him.","Whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know that something is after its life.","A man who lived on the banks of the Niger should not wash his hands with spittle.","If one finger brings oil it soils the others.","When there is a big tree small ones climb on its back to reach the sun."]
