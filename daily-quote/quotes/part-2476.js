var author2476 = "George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne", quotes2476 = ["Of all pains, the greatest painIs to love, and love in vain.","Thy thoughts to nobler meditations give,And study how to die, not how to live.","'Tis impious pleasure to delight in harm. And beauty should be kind, as well as charm.","But, oh! what mighty magician can assuageA woman's envy?","The kiss you take is paid by that you give:The joy is mutual, and I'm still in debt.","Whoe'er thou art, thy Lord and master see,Thou wast my Slave, thou art, or thou shalt be."]
