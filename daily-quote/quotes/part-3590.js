On the contrary the servile are never rightly obedient.","If thou hast sought happiness and missed it, but hast found wisdom instead, thou art fortunate.","They who can no longer unlearn have lost the power to learn.","Solitude is unbearable for those who can not bear themselves.","They who see through the eyes of others are controlled by the will of others.","The common man is impelled and controlled by interests; the superior, by ideas.","The will—the one thing it is most important to educate—we neglect.","When pleasure is made a business, it ceases to be pleasure.","What purifies the heart refines language.","If thou wouldst help others deal with them as though they were what they should be","Whom little things occupy and keep busy, are little men.","They who admire and reverence noble and heroic men are akin to them.","The able have no desire to appear to be so, and this is part of their ability.","Break not the will of the young, but guide it to right ends.","Beauty lies not in the things we see, but in the soul.","As display is vulgar, so fondness for jewelry is evidence of an uncultivated mind.","We are made ridiculous less by our defects than by the affectation of qualities which are not ours.","If truth make us not truthful, what service can it render us?","It is difficult to be sure of our friends, but it is possible to be certain of our loyalty to them.","It is not worth while to consider whether a truth be useful—it is enough that it is a truth.","Altruism is a barbarism. Love is the word.","When we know and love the best we are content to lack the approval of the many.","If thou canst not hold the golden mean, say and do too little rather than too much.","The lover of education labors first of all to educate himself.","The seeking for truth is better than its loveless possession.","The smaller the company, the larger the conversation.","Not to be able to utter one’s thought without giving offence, is to lack culture.","Base thy life on principle, not on rules.","Reform the world within thyself, which is thy proper world.","The happiness of the ignorant is but an animal’s paradise.","We truly know only what we have taught ourselves.","Insight makes argument ridiculous.","A great man, who lives intimately with his admirers, with difficulty escapes being made ridiculous.","What we acquire with joy, we possess with indifference.","The innocence which is simply ignorance is not virtue.","When one sense has been bribed the others readily bear false witness.","When the crowd acclaims its favorites it applauds itself.","Folly will run its course and it is the part of wisdom not to take it too seriously.","Where it is the chief aim to teach many things, little education is given or received.","In education, as in religion and love, compulsion thwarts the purpose for which it is employed.","One may speak Latin and have but the mind of a peasant.","They whom trifles distract and nothing occupies are but children.","It is the business of the teacher … to fortify reason and to make conscience sovereign.","A hobby is the result of a distorted view of things. It is putting a planet in the place of a sun.","The more we live with what we imagine others think of us, the less we live with truth.","If we are disappointed that men give little heed to what we utter is it for their sake or our own?","If thy friends tire of thee, remember that it is human to tire of everything.","They who think they know all, learn nothing.","Agitators and declaimers may heat the blood, but they do not illumine the mind.","Wouldst thou bestow some precious gift upon thy fellows, make thyself a noble man.","We are not masters of the truth which is borne in upon us: it overpowers us.","What we think out for ourselves forms channels in which other thoughts will flow."]
