Let's not mummify them and keep them around.","Any kind of barbarism, once established, will last.","Idleness is the mother of all vices, but also of all virtues.","Obligation spoils everything.","Happiness is a reward that comes to those that have not looked for it.","Untie, liberate, and do not be afraid. He who is free is disarmed.","When the pack is out hunting, the dogs do not fight among themselves."]
