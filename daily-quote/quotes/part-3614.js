","Preserving power, rather than increasing it, is the main goal of states. ","A state's potential power is based on the size of its population and the level of its wealth.","States have two kinds of power: latent power and military power. ","Simply put, the most powerful state is the one that prevails in a dispute.","Decapitation is a fanciful strategy.","The most dangerous states in the international system are continental powers with large armies. ","States care about relative wealth, because economic might is the foundation of military might.","Bandwagoning is a strategy for the weak.","Important benefits often accrue to states that behave in an unexpected way.","This self-defeating behavior, so the argument goes, must be the result of warped domestic politics. ","China, in short has the potential to be considerably more powerful than even the United States. "]
