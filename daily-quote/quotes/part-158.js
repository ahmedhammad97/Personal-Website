var author158 = "Aiden Wilson Tozer", quotes158 = ["It is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until He has hurt him deeply.","Truth is a glorious but hard mistress. She never consults, bargains or compromises.","Complacency is the deadly enemy of spiritual progress. The contented soul is the stagnant soul.","We have become so engrossed in the work of the Lord that we have forgotten the Lord of the work.","Whatever a man wants badly and persistently enough will determine the man's character.","Let a man set his heart only on doing the will of God and he is instantly free.","When God would make His name known to mankind, He could find no better word than I AM.","In the long pull we pray only as well as we live.","God never hurries. There are no deadlines against which He must work.","What comes to mind when we think about God is the most important thing about us. ","To be right with God has often meant to be in trouble with men."]
