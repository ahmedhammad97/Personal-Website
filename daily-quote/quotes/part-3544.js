","There are three acts of faith, assent, acceptance, and assurance.","Sometimes providences, like Hebrew letters, must be read backwards.","How much better it is to see men live exactly than to hear them argue with subtlety!","They that know God will be humble,They that know themselves cannot be proud.","The law sends us to Christ to be justified, and Christ sends us to the law to be regulated.","Christ is not sweet till sin be made bitter to us.","Christ bounds and terminates the vast desires of the soul; He is the very Sabbath of the soul."]
