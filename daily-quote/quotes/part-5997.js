It is not worth fighting over.","One who makes a gift to the deserving and needy attains the everlasting abode of Shiva.","Control over one’s tongue, and good conduct enhance one’s prestige.","A fool boasts about what little he knows. A wise man keeps quiet about what he knows and is safe.","From woman comes the new life on earth and woman is the source of all prosperity here and hereafter."]
