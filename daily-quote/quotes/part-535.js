Will she make a figure in a country church?","She looks as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.","Think not I am what I appear.","As large as life, and twice as natural.","But every thyng which schyneth as the gold,Nis nat gold, as that I have herd it told.","Hyt is not al golde that glareth.","Habit maketh no monke, ne wearing of guilt spurs maketh no knight.","Appearances to save, his only care;So things seem right, no matter what they are.","All, as they say, that glitters is not gold.","Cucullus (or Cuculla) non facit monachum.","By outward show let's not be cheated;An ass should like an ass be treated.","Things are seldom what they seem,Skim milk masquerades as cream.","Gloomy as night he stands.","Judge not according to the appearance.","All is not golde that outward shewith bright.","All is not golde that shewyth goldishe hewe.","Whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones.","All is not gold that glisteneth.","Looked as if she had walked straight out of the Ark.","A fair exterior is a silent recommendation."]
