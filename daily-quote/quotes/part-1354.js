There is more hope of a fool than of him.","I've never any pity for conceited people, because I think they carry their comfort about with them.","For what are they all in their high conceit,When man in the bush with God may meet?","The world knows only two, that's Rome and I.","In men this blunder still you find,All think their little set mankind.","Wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can tender a reason.","Conceit may puff a man up, but never prop him up.","I am not in the roll of common men.","Faith, that's as well said as if I had said it myself."]
