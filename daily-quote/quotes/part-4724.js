Morning: excellent and fair.","Morn in the white wake of the morning starCame furrowing all the orient into gold.","The meek-eyed Morn appears, mother of Dews.","Sacrament of morning.","The breezy call of incense-breathing morn.","Like pearlUpon the bashful rose.","Under the opening eyelids of the morn.","Flames in the forehead of the morning sky.","When did morning ever break,And find such beaming eyes awake?","Hadn't he been blowing kisses to Earth millions of years before I was born?","Bright chanticleer proclaims the dawnAnd spangles deck the thorn.","If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea.","At length the morn and cold indifference came.","Clothing the palpable and familiarWith golden exhalations of the dawn.","But with the morning cool reflection came.","But with the morning cool repentance came.","And yonder fly his scattered golden arrows,And smite the hills with day.","And the fresh air of incense-breathing mornShall wooingly embrace it."]
