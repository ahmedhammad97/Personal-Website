Love of God is the fruit, and rituals are the blossom.","I have no disciple. I am the servant of the servant of Rama.","If one has faith one has everything.","As the snake is separate from its slough, even so is the Spirit separate from the body.","Forgiveness is the true nature of the ascetic.","Honour both spirit and form, the sentiment within as well as the symbol without.","Unless one always speaks the truth, one cannot find God Who is the soul of truth.","Who is whose Guru? God alone is the guide and Guru of the universe.","Do yourself what you wish others to do.","As long as I live, so long do I learn."]
