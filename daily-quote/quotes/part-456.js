var author456 = "Anna Letitia Barbauld", quotes456 = ["I read his awful name, emblazon'd highWith golden letters on th' illumin'd sky.","Come calm content serene and sweet,To find thy hermit cell.","Man is the nobler growth our realms supply,And souls are ripened in our northern sky.","This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,And Wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.","It is to hope, though hope were lost."]
