Death is the only sincerity.","I fall on my blade; crimson blossoms seed the earth; the spring buds drink deep.","One should make his decisions within the space of seven breaths.","The old carp is wise; he whispers his dark secrets; only the wind hears.","My eyes grow heavy; as blackened storm clouds grow near; engulfing the sun.","It is also said that: The man who hunts a deer does not gaze at the mountains.","Cunning tanuki; he preys upon my humble soul; I have no defence.","Although I greet death; I do not fear its icy grip; my soul is at peace.","Willows slowly stoop; preparing to meet the ground; as autumn arrives.","The dark tiger stalks; my soul quivers in the air; just for a moment.","When you cannot be deceived by men you will have realised the wisdom of strategy.","A doll floats downstream; carrying with it prayers; spring has come at last.","Raindrops on the lake; a universe of ripples; centre touching all.","A samurai with no group and no horse is not a samurai at all.","I grow old and hunch; as gnarled branches turn downwards; returning to roots.","Sheltering cherry; my last breath stirs your blossom; my soul ascends. Meh.","If you are slain in battle, you should be resolved to have your corpse facing the enemy.","To die by the sword; no finer honour exists; winter’s grip awaits.","Fish break the surface; and a reflection shatters; momentarily.","Autumn maple leaves; their colours, like the harvest; remind me of home.","Give my dream back raven! The moon you woke me to is misted over.","Melting icicles; once proud soldiers, lose all form; returning to streams.","A tree’s skeleton; exposed by autumn season; ready for new life.","Blossom on the breeze; settles on the face of a corpse; beauty masking death.","Everything grows cold; stillness like a frozen lake; there will be no thaw.","A cold, low whistle; accompanies my last breath; wind in sympathy.","Take care of yourself so you can serve your master.","Sunset seduces; each step brings me no closer; the horizon flees.","The new year begins; my eyes hunger for the sight; of my last sunrise.","A flash of lightning; illuminates man’s journey; then darkness returns.","Laying in the shade; dappled sunlight warms my face; a welcome farewell.","Snowflakes in the air; a cold wind carries them on; to my sacred home.","A soul ship finds me; crystal waters call my name; I am dragged below.","An affected laugh shows lack of self-respect in a man and lewdness in a woman.","Twice I awaken; once at the first burst of spring; once in wintertime.","The warmth of summer; an arrow floats on the breeze; bringing with it death.","Up into the sky; I kiss the falling snowflakes; as they pass me by.","My acts mark the land; time makes ghosts of every deed; as snow hides footprints.","It is carelessness to go about with one's hands inside the slits in the sides of his hakama.","Through the autumn fields; his steed, swift as typhoon winds; the arrow, fleeter.","The depths of winter; the wolf stalks his prey by night; red blood on white snow.","My wake leaves little; but as ripples reach the sea; they become great waves.","Crossing the river; takes me from the familiar; to new adventures.","Dreaded shikome! The winter of life revealed; my soul is now free.","By bringing shame to a person, how could one expect to make him a better man?"]
