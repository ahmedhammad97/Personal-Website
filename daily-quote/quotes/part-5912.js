Thus was Sabbath kept.","See Christians, Jews, one heavy sabbath keep,And all the western world believe and sleep.","E'en Sunday shines no Sabbath day to me.","Sundaies observe: think when the bells do chime,'Tis angel's musick; therefore come not late.","The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.","The sabbaths of Eternity,One sabbath deep and wide.","There are many persons who think Sunday is a sponge with which to wipe out the sins of the week.","Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,The bridal of the earth and sky.","Sunday is the golden clasp that binds together the volume of the week."]
