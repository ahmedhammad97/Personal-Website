Alger", quotes7171 = ["Most men give advice by the bucket, but take it by the grain.","When man seized the loadstone of science, the loadstar of superstition vanished in the clouds.","Men often make up in wrath what they want in reason.","God's mills grind slow,But they grind woe.","Fill up the goblet and reach to me some!Drinking makes wise, but dry fasting makes glum.","The moon is a silver pin-head vast,That holds the heaven's tent-hangings fast."]
