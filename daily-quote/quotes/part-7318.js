I should know.","I don't wanna' wonder whether you love me I don't wanna' wonder whether you care","When I saw you smile I saw a dream come true","I won't be waitin' any more cause I know I was made for you","Sweet darlinâ€™, come hold me, Just a little bit longer now","What's in my pocket?So well, as I knew you","Well Im back in your good graces again Remember when you told me that I was your only friend?","Shut your eyes, there are bluer skies For you're embraced in my heart "]
