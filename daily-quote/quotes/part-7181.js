Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.","He is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this.","Forty thousand brothersMake up my sum.","By heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme, and to be melancholy.","You would for paradise break faith and troth,And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.","A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind. A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound.","And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.","But love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit.","And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love.","Good night, sweet friend: thy love ne'er alter, till thy sweet life end","Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.","Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most, to my capacity.","When you depart from me sorrow abides, and happiness takes his leave.","Speak low, if you speak love.","Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.","Perdition catch my soul,Chaos is come again.","From love's weak childish bow she lives unharmed.","Steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.","Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;Cry butâ€”Ay me! pronounce but love and dove.","O, Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou, Romeo?","For stony limits cannot hold love out,And what love can do that dares love attempt.","At lovers' perjuries,They say, Jove laughs.","Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.","Sweet, above thought I love thee.","For to be wise, and love Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.","The noblest hateful love that e'er I heard of.","Journeys end in lovers meeting,Every wise man's son doth know.","Then let thy love be younger than thyself,Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.","Love sought is good, but giv'n unsought is better.","For he was more than over shoes in love.","Except I be by Sylvia in the night,There is no music in the nightingale.","They do not love that do not show their love.","Love keeps his revels where there are but twain.","What 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?","Love comforteth like sunshine after rain","Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain"]
