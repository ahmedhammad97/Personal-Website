Important, no doubt, but a book.","Death is the inventor of God.","The possibility of the impossible, dreams and illusions, are the subject of my novels.","That night the blind man dreamt that he was blind.","This is the stuff we're made of, half indifference and half malice.","Perhaps only in a world of the blind will things be what they truly are.","The difficult thing isn't living with other people, it's understanding them.","Blind people do not need a name, I am my voice, nothing else matters.","If I'm sincere today, what does it matter if I regret it tomorrow?","You know the name you were given, You do not know the name you have","[...], perhaps that's how you learn, by answering questions.","Consciences keep silence more often than they should, that's why laws were created.","No life is without its lies.","In order to protect the physical hygiene and mental health of the living, we usually bury the dead.","What the eye doesn’t see the heart doesn’t grieve over.","That it’s possible not to see a lie even when it’s in front of us.","Forgive me if what has seemed little to you, to me is all.","Destiny isn’t taken in by people trying to make what came first come afterwards.","Even the strongest spirits have the moments of irresistible weakness,","Earthenware is like people, it needs to be well treated.","The only time we can talk about death is while we’re alive, not afterwards.","Where do begin, he asked, Where you always have to begin, at the beginning,","Each part in itself constitutes the whole to which it belongs.","Age carries with it a double load of guilt,","Don’t quibble with the king over pears, let him eat the ripe ones and give you the green ones.","It’s is the old who age a day every hour,","The best way to killing a rose is to force it open when it is still only the promise of a bud.","Creating is always so much more stimulating than destroying.","Lord knows why they depict death with wings when death is everywhere.","Words were not given to man in order to conceal his thoughts.","[T]here are times when it is best to be content with what one has, so as not to lose everything.","Worse still if that sameness should ever become total."]
