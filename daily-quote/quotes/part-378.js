var author378 = "Anacreon", quotes378 = ["To-day belongs to me,To-morrow who can tell.","Persuasion's flowing well.","Whence can we the future learn?Life to mortals is obscure.","But when an old man dances,But he's a child in mind.","I fled the headless darts of slanderous tongue.","E'en though I would not, die I must;Why stray I thus through life?","And last of all comes death."]
