Their passions forge their fetters.","All learned, and all drunk!","Gloriously drunk, obey the important call.","Then hasten to be drunk, the business of the day.","A man may choose whether he will have abstemiousness and knowledge, or claret and ignorance.","Touch the goblet no more!To its very core!","O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack!","Sweet fellowship in shame!One drunkard loves another of the name.","Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.","A drunkard clasp his teeth and not undo 'em,To suffer wet damnation to run through 'em.","He calls drunkenness an expression identical with ruin."]
