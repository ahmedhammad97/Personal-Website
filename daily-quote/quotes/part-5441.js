Awake, my God; decree justice.","O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is throughout the earth!","Jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one;He hates anyone who loves violence.","The heavens are declaring the glory of God; The skies above proclaim the work of his hands.","The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.","I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.","He loveth righteousness and justice: The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Jehovah.","My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, Where is your God?","In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge: Let me never be put to shame.","That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. ","Jehovah will be at your right hand;He will crush kings on the day of his anger.","Jehovah guards all those who love him,But all the wicked he will annihilate."]
