","No one knows the weight of anothes burden.","Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms.","Do all you can and leave the rest to providence.","A truth teller finds the doors closed against him.","A fox should not be of the jury at a goose's trial.","Burn not your house to fright away the mice.","Misfortunes come by forties.","Death meets us everywhere.","As a man lives so shall he die. As a tree falls so shall it lie."]
