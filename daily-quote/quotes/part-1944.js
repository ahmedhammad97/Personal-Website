","Better to wear worn shoes than to polish the boots of shop owner.","Forewarned is forearmed. ","Just keep following my tears, and the brook will take you in.","The criteria of art are the imponderable, the immeasurable.","Art and order, the relative that refuse to relate.","Art is not a Trojan horse.","Don’t start anything you can’t finish.","In this new era, what sets you free is knowledge, not work. ","The rules of art do not exist, because what makes art art is the fact that it obeys no rules at all.","Nothing is natural, yet everything is as it is by nature.","Intellectuals will still go on emphasizing free will even when they’ve got nothing left to eat. ","Money is unimportant, but it is reassuring to have it.","Death the Laveller annihilates all distinctions.","nothing comes of nothing after all.","often these women marry or they are ruined some other way.","sewing in itself is already in the women's blood.","if someone has a fate, then it's a man, if someone gets a fate, then it's a woman.","Happiness happens by chance, and is not a law or the logical consequences of actions. ","I don’t know if it’s enough for a whole life, a man wants to enjoy many women, a man is different.","One suffers work, even if one enjoys doing it. "]
