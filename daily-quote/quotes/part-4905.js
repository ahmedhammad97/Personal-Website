O darkly fostered ray!Thou hast a joy too deep for shallow Day.","Sable-vested Night, eldest of things.","Darkness now rose,Her shadowy offspring.","Silence, ye wolves! while Ralph to Cynthia howls,And makes night hideous;â€”Answer him, ye owls!","In the dead vast and middle of the night.","And night is fled,Whose pitchy mantle overveil'd the earth.","I must become a borrower of the nightFor a dark hour or twain.","The night is long that never finds the day.","This is the nightThat either makes me or fordoes me quite.","Come, gentle night, come, loving, blackbrow'd night.","Night is a stealthy, evil Raven, Wrapt to the eyes in his black wings.","Wan night, the shadow goer, came stepping in.","When it draws near to witching time of night.","Night's black Mantle covers all alike.","Now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light,And drew behind the cloudy vale of night.","Watchman, what of the night?","The night cometh when no man can work.","I heard the trailing garments of the NightSweep through her marble halls.","Then stars arise, and the night is holy.","Night hath a thousand eyes.","There never was night that had no morn.","Day is ended, Darkness shroudsThe shoreless seas and lowering clouds.","On dreary night let lusty sunshine fall.","To all, to each, a fair good night,And pleasing dreams; and slumbers light.","Swiftly walk over the western wave, Spirit of Night!","Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills,Like footsteps upon wool.","Night begins to muffle up the day.","Mine is the night, with all her stars."]
