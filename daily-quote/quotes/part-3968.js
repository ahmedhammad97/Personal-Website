Ever elusive and ever tensional","Real genuine joy is borne of sadness and sorrow.","Joy emerges from my little, timid life/ of everydayness and temerity.","There is a deeper joy in emptying ourselves.","The paradox of life is: Joy prepares one for more sadness and the other way around also.","After realising the depth of tragedy, we can and need to be joyful in hope.","The secret of joy is: To know the world and its evil powers ... and still preserve the hope.","The reward of joy is joy itself; not for its own sake; but for the sake of others.","The joy that is everywhere/ Is the true joy of being/ The joy that is life itself!","Love enables the emergence of ecstasy/ That of enchantment with life","By sharing it [love] grows/ By giving it up it nurtures/ By dying it deepens./ By being it becomes.","My deepest human longing is/ Not to control the world and people/ But to control and realise myself!","Freedom is the expression of my truest self/ The cry of being deepest being!","Freedom makes life not easy/ But noble and worthwhile!","Freedom is the flow of life/ It is to be part of it/ And to let life flow through you.","Freedom is basically a spiritual longing/ That can only be filled by a spiritual power.","The spiritual freedom, once relished and tasted/ Is ready to give up everything."]
