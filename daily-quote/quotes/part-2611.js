","All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.","In him was life; and the life was the light of men. ","And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.","If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.","He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.","Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.","Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.","I and my Father are one.","Jesus wept.","I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.","He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.","If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.","My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you."]
