var author435 = "Angelus Silesius", quotes435 = ["No thought for the hereafter have the wise, for on this very earth they live in paradise","Saints do not die. It is their lot, To die while on this earth to all that God is not. ","Even before I was me, I was God in God; And I can be once again, as soon as I am dead to myself","Time is eternity and eternity is time, just as long as you yourself don't make them different","I know God couldn't live a moment without me; if I should disappear, He would die, destitute","No man has known perfect felicity, Until his otherness is drowned in unity","God is a flowing well which constantly may pour Into his whole Creation, and yet be as before."]
