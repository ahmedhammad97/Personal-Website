No sweet fruit comes from a bitter seed.","The tyranny of some is possible only through the cowardice of others.","Man works for an object. Remove that object and you reduce him into inaction.","Man is multiplied by the number of languages he possesses and speaks. ","Virtue lies in the middle ground.","Law has no skin, reason has no nostrils."]
