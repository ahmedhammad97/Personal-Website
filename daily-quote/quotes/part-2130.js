[Motto of Vraibleusia.]","He was fash and full of faith that something would turn up.","Everything comes if a man will only wait.","He hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.","Expectation whirls me round.That it enchants my sense.","'Tis silence all,And pleasing expectation.","Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes. ","What else remains for me?To build a new life on a ruined life.","Blessed is he who expects nothing for he shall never be disappointed.","'Tis expectation makes a blessing dear;Heaven were not Heaven, if we knew what it were.","Blessed are those that nought expect,For they shall not be disappointed.","It is folly to expect men to do all that they may reasonably be expected to do."]
