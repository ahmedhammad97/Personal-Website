That is how important you are!","The ego … reduces the present to a means to an end.","Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within.","The past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation. … Both are illusions.","Only by awakening can you know the true meaning of that word.","Awareness is the greatest agent for change.","You cannot be both unhappy and fully present in the Now.","When you lose touch with inner stillness, you lose touch with yourself.","Suffering has a noble purpose: the evolution of the consciousness and the burning up of the ego.","A new species is arising on the planet. It is arising now, and you are it!","Being must be felt. It can't be thought.","Presence is a state of inner spaciousness.","Nonresistance is the key to the greatest power in the universe.","The human condition: lost in thought.","Life is the dancer and you are the dance.","What you react to in others, you strengthen in yourself.","When you accept everything for what it is without labels you are outside of your ego.","Right now we are being given the experience we need to raise our consciousness."]
