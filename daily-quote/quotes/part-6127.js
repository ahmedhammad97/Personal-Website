And none shall ever be my master!","Paradise unearned is but a land of shadows!","Rather let me fail ... than never to have tried at all!","Where soars the Silver Surfer....

The evil is yours â€” but the triumph is mine!","You'll find my power comes from within.... and is a force to be reckoned with.","Obviously my best strategy is to wait, listen, and learn.","What have my actions brought...?","The Silver Surfer stands with humankind this day!","Drink deep, aged one.
