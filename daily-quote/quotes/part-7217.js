Like our shadows,Our wishes lengthen as our sun declines.","Man wants but little here below,Nor wants that little long.","And the evil wish is most evil to the wisher.","With all thy sober charms possest,Whose wishes never learnt to stray.","I wish I knew the good of wishing.","Wishers and woulders be small householders."]
