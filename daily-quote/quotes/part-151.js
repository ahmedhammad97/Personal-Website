var author151 = "Agriculture", quotes151 = ["Ten acres and a mule.","Three acres and a cow.","Farming as we do it is hunting, and in the sea we act like barbarians.","The first farmer was the first man, and all historic nobility rests on possession and use of land.","Earth is here so kind, that just tickle her with a hoe and she laughs with a harvest.","The life of the husbandman,—a life fed by the bounty of earth and sweetened by the airs of heaven.","Adam, well may we labour, still to dressThis garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower.","Where grows?—where grows it not? If vain our toil,We ought to blame the culture, not the soil.","Here Ceres' gifts in waving prospect stand,And nodding tempt the joyful reaper's hand.","Ill husbandry liethWhere profit to get.","Blessed be agriculture! if one does not have too much of it."]
