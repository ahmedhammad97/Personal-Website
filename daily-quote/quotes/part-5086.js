They go together like coffee and cream.","Laws are confusing documents. They get in the way of justice.","If you bargain when they squeeze your balls, they will only squeeze again.","Laws are a fine thing on paper, but painful when no bribery can ease their bind.","Politics is ugly. Never doubt what small men will do for great power."]
