","A series of accidents creates a positively light-hearted state.","One day, we shall stand up and our backsides will remain attached to our seats.","Challenge, and not desire, lies at the heart of seduction. (p. 57)","Distinctive signs, full signs, never seduce us. (p. 59)","For nothing can be greater than seduction itself, not even the order that destroys it."]
