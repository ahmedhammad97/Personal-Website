var author3683 = "John Webster", quotes3683 = ["I saw him going the way of all flesh.","But keep the wolf far thence, that's foe to men,For with his nails he'll dig them up again.","Prosperity doth bewitch men, seeming clear;But seas do laugh, show white, when rocks are near.","Glories, like glowworms, afar off shine bright,But looked to near have neither heat nor light.","I know death hath ten thousand several doorsFor men to take their exits.","Whether we fall by ambition, blood, or lust,Like diamonds, we are cut with our own dust."]
