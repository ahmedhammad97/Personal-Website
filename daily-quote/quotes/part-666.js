var author666 = "Augustine of Hippo", quotes666 = ["The confession of evil works is the first beginning of good works.","Will is to grace as the horse is to the rider.","The weakness of little children's limbs is innocent, not their souls.","In a quarrel for earth, turn not to earth.","The mind itself, its love of itself and its knowledge of itself are a kind of trinity.","We make a ladder of our vices, if we trample those same vices underfoot.","Anger is a weed; hate is the tree.","He who created you without you will not justify you without you.","So the Church too, like Mary, enjoys perpetual virginity and uncorrupted fecundity.","You can live, provided you live; that is, you can live for ever, provided you live a good life.","Christ is not valued at all unless He be valued above all.","Thou hast made us for Thyself, and the heart never resteth till it findeth rest in Thee.","It is no advantage to be near the light if the eyes are closed."]
