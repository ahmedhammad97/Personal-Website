var author4625 = "Michel de Montaigne", quotes4625 = ["As for extraordinary things, all the provision in the world would not suffice.","In my opinion, every rich man is a miser.","Things are not bad in themselves, but our cowardice makes them so.","Whatever can be done another day can be done today.","All the opinions in the world point out that pleasure is our aim.","He who would teach men to die would teach them to live.","The day of your birth leads you to death as well as to life.","Live as long as you please, you will strike nothing off the time you will have to spend dead.","All of the days go toward death and the last one arrives there.","We must not attach knowledge to the mind, we have to incorporate it there.","Every other knowledge is harmful to him who does not have knowledge of goodness.","He who does not give himself leisure to be thirsty cannot take pleasure in drinking.","There is as much difference between us and ourselves as between us and others.","The sage says that all that is under heaven incurs the same law and the same fate.","As far as fidelity is concerned, there is no animal in the world as treacherous as man.","The plague of man is boasting of his knowledge.","Man is forming thousands of ridiculous relations between himself and God.","How many valiant men we have seen to survive their own reputation!","A man may be humble through vainglory.","I find that the best goodness I have has some tincture of vice.","Saying is one thing and doing is another.","As far as physicians go, chance is more valuable than knowledge.","Physicians have this advantage: the sun lights their success and the earth covers their failures.","I will follow the good side right to the fire, but not into it if I can help it.","Few men have been admired by their own households.","Malice sucks up the greatest part of its own venom, and poisons itself.","A man must be a little mad if he does not want to be even more stupid.","I have seen no more evident monstrosity and miracle in the world than myself.","There is no wish more natural than the wish to know.","Let us give Nature a chance; she knows her business better than we do.","Lend yourself to others, but give yourself to yourself.","Man in sooth is a marvellous, vain, fickle, and unstable subject.","All passions that suffer themselves to be relished and digested are but moderate.","He who should teach men to die would at the same time teach them to live.","The laws of conscience, which we pretend to be derived from nature, proceed from custom.","There are some defeats more triumphant than victories.","Nothing is so firmly believed as what we least know.","A wise man never loses anything, if he has himself.","Even opinion is of force enough to make itself to be espoused at the expense of life.","And not to serve for a table-talk.","When I play with my cat, who knows whether I do not make her more sport than she makes me?","Man is certainly stark mad; he cannot make a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens.","He that I am reading seems always to have the most force.","How many worthy men have we seen survive their own reputation!","One may be humble out of pride.","I find that the best virtue I have has in it some tincture of vice.","Saying is one thing, doing another.","Nature forms us for ourselves, not for others; to be, not to seem.","The public weal requires that men should betray and lie and massacre.","Like rowers, who advance backward.","Few men have been admired by their own domestics.","And to bring in a new word by the head and shoulders, they leave out the old one.","All the world knows me in my book, and my book in me.","What if he has borrowed the matter and spoiled the form, as it oft falls out? ","The oldest and best known evil was ever more supportable than one that was new and untried.","Not because Socrates said so,â€¦ I look upon all men as my compatriots.","My appetite comes to me while eating.","Saturninus said, Comrades, you have lost a good captain to make him an ill general.","A little folly is desirable in him that will not be guilty of stupidity.","Habit is a second nature.","We seek and offer ourselves to be gulled.","I have never seen a greater monster or miracle in the world than myself.","Men are most apt to believe what they least understand.","For truth itself has not the privilege to be spoken at all times and in all sorts.","The diversity of physical arguments and opinions embraces all sorts of methods."]
