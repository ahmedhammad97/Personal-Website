var author4678 = "Misers", quotes4678 = ["A mere madness, to live like a wretch, and die rich.","Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill;Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still.","His heart is like a maggot-eaten nut:There's nothing in it ; but 'tis closely shut. ","The unsunn'd heapsOf miser's treasures.","Decrepit miser; base, ignoble wretch;I am descended of a gentler blood.","Misers are evil people,"]
