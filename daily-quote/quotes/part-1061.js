","There are times when the utmost daring is the height of wisdom.","Timidity is the root of prudence in the majority of men.","Boldness governed by superior intellect is the mark of a hero.","The state of crisis is the real war; the equilibrium is nothing but its reflex.","All war presupposes human weakness and seeks to exploit it.","Chapter 1.","Chapter 2.","Chapter 5","Chapter 11.","Chapter 17."]
