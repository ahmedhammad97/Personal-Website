Tolkien", quotes3166 = ["Wars are not favourable to delicate pleasures.","I have the hatred of apartheid in my bones...","Every morning I wake up and think good, another 24 hours' pipe-smoking.","In such 'fantasy', as it is called, new form is made; Faerie begins; Man becomes a sub-creator.","Small wonder that spell means both a story told, and a formula of power over living men.","A story must be told or there'll be no story, yet it is the untold stories that are most moving.","'Power' is an ominous and sinister word in all these tales, except as applied to the gods."]
