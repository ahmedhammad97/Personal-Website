The always seen no longer exists.","Everything you rejected and pushed aside—take it up again.","Nothing was better for you than humiliation, for there was nothing you felt more deeply.","I repulse death with all my strength. If I accepted it, I would be a murderer.","The unconscious, which those who always speak of it least possess.","Relearn astonishment, stop grasping for knowledge, lose the habit of the past.","When he has nothing to say, he lets words speak."]
