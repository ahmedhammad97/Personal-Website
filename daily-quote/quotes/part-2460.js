O, what is man,Unless he be a Politician?","Who to himself is law no law doth need,Offends no law, and is a king indeed.","Each natural agent works but to this end,â€”To render that it works on like itself.","Man is a name of honour for a king.","'Tis immortality to die aspiring,As if a man were taken quick to heaven.","He is at no end of his actions blestWhose ends will make him greatest, and not best.","The lady of the light, the rosy-fingered Morn,Rose from the hills.","As far as white Aurora's dews are sprinkled through the air."]
