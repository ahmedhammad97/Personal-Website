var author7094 = "William Cowper", quotes7094 = ["True Charity, a plant divinely nurs'd.","Thus neither the praise nor the blame is our own.","I believe no man was ever scolded out of his sins.","An honest man, close-buttoned to the chin,Broadcloth without, and a warm heart within.","Shine by the side of every path we treadWith such a luster, he that runs may read.","Beware of desp'rate steps! The darkest day(Live till tomorrow) will have passed away.","Misery still delights to traceIts semblance in another's case.","A knave, when tried on honesty's plain rule,And, when by that of reason, a mere fool","And Satan trembles when he seesThe weakest saint upon his knees.","Behind a frowning providenceHe hides a smiling face.","I play with syllables and sport in song","Glory, builtOn selfish principles, is shame and guilt.","Is base in kind, and born to be a slave.","As if the world and they were hand and glove.","Thus happiness depends, as Nature shows,Less on exterior things than most suppose.","Freedom has a thousand charms to show,That slaves, howe'er contented, never know.","Manner is all in all, whate'er is writ,The substitute for genius, sense, and wit.","Elegant as simplicity, and warmAs ecstasy.","Low ambition and the thirst of praise.","Made poetry a mere mechanic art.","Lights of the world, and stars of human race.","Remorse, the fatal egg by Pleasure laid.","How much a dunce that has been sent to roamExcels a dunce that has been kept at home!","No wild enthusiast ever yet could rest,Till half mankind were like himself possess'd.","He would not, with a peremptory tone,Assert the nose upon his face his own.","A moral, sensible, and well-bred manWill not affront me, and no other can.","I cannot talk with civet in the room,A fine puss-gentleman that's all perfume.","The solemn fop; significant and budge;A fool with judges, amongst fools a judge.","His wit invites you by his looks to come,But when you knock it never is at home.","Our wasted oil unprofitably burns,Like hidden lamps in old sepulchral urns.","That good diffused may more abundant grow.","But that disease when soberly definedIs the false fire of an o'erheated mind.","A business with an income at its heelsFurnishes always oil for its own wheels.","Absence of occupation is not rest,A mind quite vacant is a mind distressed.","An idler is a watch that wants both hands; As useless when it goes as when it stands.","Built God a church, and laugh'd his word to scorn.","Religion! what treasure untoldResides in that heavenly word!","Though on pleasure she was bent,She had a frugal mind.","A hat not much the worse for wear.","United yet divided, twain at once:So sit two kings of Brentford on one throne.","God made the country, and man made the town.","Fast-anchor'd isle.","Presume to lay their hand upon the arkOf her magnificent and awful cause.","There is a pleasure in poetic painsWhich only poets know.","Whoe'er was edified, themselves were not.","O Popular Applause! what heart of manIs proof against thy sweet seducing charms? ","Variety's the very spice of life,That gives it all its flavour.","She that asksHer dear five hundred friends.","Domestic happiness, thou only blissOf Paradise that has survived the fall!","I was a stricken deer that left the herdLong since.","Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream.","Detested sport,That owes its pleasures to another's pain.","Who loves a garden loves a greenhouse too.","Which not even critics criticise.","What is it but a map of busy life,Its fluctuations, and its vast concerns?","While fancy, like the finger of a clock,Runs the great circuit, and is still at home.","O Winter, ruler of the inverted year!","In indolent vacuity of thought.","It seems the part of wisdom.","All learned, and all drunk!","Gloriously drunk, obey the important call.","The Frenchman's darling.","Silently as a dream the fabric rose &mdash;No sound of hammer or of saw was there.","But war's a game, which, were their subjects wise,Kings would not play at.","The beggarly last doit.","As dreadful as the Manichean god,Adored through fear, strong only to destroy.","The still small voice is wanted.","He is the freeman whom the truth makes free.","Give what Thou canst, without Thee we are poor;And with Thee rich, take what Thou wilt away.","Some to the fascination of a nameSurrender judgment hoodwink'd.","Nature is but a name for an effect,Whose cause is God.","Not a flowerOf his unrivall'd pencil.","Prove that you have human feelings,Ere you proudly question ours!","Survivor sole, and hardly such, of allthat once lived here","Just knows, and knows no more, her Bible true,â€”A truth the brilliant Frenchman never knew.","The sounding jargon of the schools.","A kick that scarce would move a horseMay kill a sound divine.","There goes the parson, O illustrious spark!And there, scarce less illustrious, goes the clerk.","And the tear that is wiped with a little address,May be follow'd perhaps by a smile.","'T is Providence alone securesIn every change both mine and yours.","I shall not ask Jean Jacques RousseauIf birds confabulate or no.","The path of sorrow, and that path alone,Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown.","Oh that those lips had language! Life has pass'dWith me but roughly since I heard thee last.","The son of parents pass'd into the skies.","A worm is in the bud of youth,And at the root of age.","There is a bird who by his coat,Might be supposed a crow.","But strive still to be a man before your mother."]
