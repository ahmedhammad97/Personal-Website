var author3582 = "John Keats", quotes3582 = ["Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong,And doubly sweet a brotherhood in song.","Here lies one whose name was writ in water.","My chest of books divide amongst my friends.","The sweet converse of an innocent mind.","The imagination may be compared to Adam's dream — he awoke and found it truth.","O for a life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts!","They will explain themselves — as all poems should do without any comment.","Works of genius are the first things in this world.","Scenery is fine — but human nature is finer.","Every mental pursuit takes its reality and worth from the ardour of the pursuer.","There is an awful warmth about my heart like a load of immortality.","I think I shall be among the English Poets after my death.","Call the world if you please The vale of soul-making.","I have nothing to speak of but my self-and what can I say but what I feel","I can scarcely bid you good-bye, even in a letter. I always made an awkward bow. God bless you!","Open afresh your round of starry folds,Ye ardent marigolds!","Woman! when I behold thee flippant, vain,Inconstant, childish, proud, and full of fancies.","E’en like the passage of an angel’s tearThat falls through the clear ether silently.","The poetry of earth is never dead.","There is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object.","Time, that aged nurse,Rocked me to patience.","Pleasure is oft a visitant; but painClings cruelly to us.","'Tis the pestOf love, that fairest joys give most unrest.","So many, and so many, and such glee.","That large utterance of the early gods!","The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled.","Knowledge enormous makes a God of me.","Love in a hut, with water and a crust,Is — Love, forgive us! — cinders, ashes, dust.","“For cruel ’tis,” said she,“To steal my Basil-pot away from me.”","So let me be thy choir, and make a moanUpon the midnight hours","Music's golden tongueFlatter'd to tears this aged man and poor.","The silver snarling trumpets 'gan to chide.","The music, yearning like a God in pain.","A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing.","As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.","And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,In blanched linen, smooth, and lavender’d.","And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon.","He play'd an ancient ditty long since mute,In Provence call'd La belle dame sans mercy.","And they are gone: ay, ages long agoThese lovers fled away into the storm.","Already with thee! tender is the night.","Forlorn! the very word is like a bellTo toil me back from thee to my sole self!","Was it a vision, or a waking dream?Fled is that music: — Do I wake or sleep?"]
