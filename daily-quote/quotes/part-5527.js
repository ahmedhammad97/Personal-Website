The nature of (this) knowledge is existence-consciousness-bliss.","The place where even the slightest trace of the 'I' does not exist, alone is Self.","The Self itself is God.","Let knowledge be guessed by the sign of equality to all beings.","14. Just as the sun gives light to the moon this heart bestows the effulgence on the mind.","True silence is really endless speech.","There is no greater mystery than this: being Reality ourselves, we seek to gain Reality.","I want you to dive consciously into the Self, i.e., into the Heart.","Unless one is happy, one cannot bestow happiness on others.","Forgetfulness of your real nature is true death; remembrance of it is rebirth","Your own Self-realization is the greatest service you can render the world.","Silence is most powerful. Speech is always less powerful than silence.","What message is needed when heart speaks to heart?"]
