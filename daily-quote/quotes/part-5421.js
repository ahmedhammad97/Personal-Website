Veels vithin veels, a prison in a prison.","The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.","Happiness is a prison, Evey. Happiness is the most insidious prison of all.","In durance vile here must I wake and weep,And all my frowsy couch in sorrow steep.","Prison'd in a parlour snug and small,Like bottled wasps upon a southern wall.","As if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel."]
