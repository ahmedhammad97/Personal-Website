","Those who make revolutions by halves do nothing but dig their own tombs.","I have not found a single good man in government; I have found good only in the people.","Most arts have produced miracles, while the art of government has produced nothing but monsters.","A nation regenerates itself only upon heaps of corpses.","Dare! â€” this word contains all the politics of our revolution.","Happiness is a new idea in Europe.","Let Revolutionists be Romans, not Tatars.","I am not of any faction, I will fight them all."]
