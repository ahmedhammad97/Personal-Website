Sophonisba, O!","Shade, unperceiv'd, so softening into shade.","From seeming evil still educing good.","See, Winter comes to rule the varied year,Sullen and sad.","Welcome, kindred glooms!Congenial horrors, hail!","Cruel as death, and hungry as the grave.","There studious let me sit,And hold high converse with the mighty dead.","The kiss, snatch'd hasty from the sidelong maid.","The meek-ey'd Morn appears, mother of dews.","Falsely luxurious, will not man awake?","But yonder comes the powerful king of day,Rejoicing in the east.","Ships dim-discovered dropping from the clouds.","And Mecca saddens at the long delay.","For many a day, and many a dreadful night,Incessant lab'ring round the stormy cape.","Sighed and looked unutterable things.","A lucky chance, that oft decides the fateOf mighty monarchs.","Who stemm'd the torrent of a downward age.","Come, gentle Spring! ethereal mildness, come.","Base Envy withers at anotherâ€™s joy,And hates that excellence it cannot reach.","But who can paintAmid its gay creation, hues like hers?","Amid the roses fierce Repentance rearsHer snaky crest.","Delightful task! to rear the tender thought,To teach the young idea how to shoot.","For lovelinessBut is when unadorned adorned the most.","He saw her charming, but he saw not halfThe charms her downcast modesty conceal'd.","For still the world prevail'd, and its dread laugh,Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn.","They who are pleased themselves must always please.","He ceased; but still their trembling ears retainedThe deep vibrations of his witching song.","Plac'd far amid the melancholy main.","Scoundrel maxim.","But what most showed the vanity of lifeWas to behold the nations all on fire.","A little, round, fat, oily man of God."]
