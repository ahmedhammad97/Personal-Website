Renew the light, lewd whisper.","Bless me and the maze I'm in!Hello, thingy spirit.","I have gone into the waste lonely placesBehind the eye.","Too much reality can be a dazzle, a surfeit; Too close immediacy an exhaustion","Being, not doing, is my first joy.","Pain wanders through my bones like a lost fire;What burns me now? Desire, desire, desire.","I bleed my bones, their marrow to bestowUpon that God who knows what I would know.","Poetry is not a mere shuffling of dead words or even a corralling of live ones. (p. 89)","You can't make poetry simply by avoiding clichés.","There's a point where plainness is no longer a virtue, when it becomes excessively bald, wrenched.","You must believe: a poem is a holy thing — a good poem, that is."]
