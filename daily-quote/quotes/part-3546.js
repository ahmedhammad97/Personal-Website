var author3546 = "John Ford (dramatist)", quotes3546 = ["Her words are trusty heralds to her mind. ","Oh, happy kings,Whose thrones are raised in their subjects' hearts. ","Sister, look ye,I've shook off old mortality. ","FlatteryIs monstrous in a true friend. ","Tell us, pray, what devilMen into monsters. ","MelancholyOf body, but the mind's disease. ","Philosophers dwell in the moon. ","Fly hence, shadows, that do keep,Watchful sorrows, charmed in sleep.","Tempt not the stars, young man, thou canst not playWith the severity of fate. ","GloriesAnd shadows soon decaying. ","Revenge proves its own executioner. ","Truth is child of time. ","He hath shook hands with time. ","Nice philosophyBut heaven admits no jest. ","Brother, even by my mother's dust, I charge you,Do not betray me to your mirth or hate. ","Delay in vengeance gives a heavier blow. ","Busy opinion is an idle fool. ","Let them fear bondage who are slaves to fear;The sweetest freedom is an honest heart. ","We can drink till all look blue. "]
