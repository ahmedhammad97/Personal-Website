var author603 = "Arthur Hugh Clough", quotes603 = ["A world where nothing is had for nothing.","So in the sinful streets, abstracted and alone,I with my secret self held communing of mine own.","Hope conquers cowardice, joy grief;Or at least, faith unbelief.","In front the sun climbs slow, how slowly,But westward, look, the land is bright.","No graven images may beWorshipped, except the currency.","Thou shalt not covet, but traditionApproves all forms of competition."]
