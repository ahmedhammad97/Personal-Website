var author1819 = "Ecclesiastes", quotes1819 = ["Laughter, I said, is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?","He hath made everything beautiful in its time.","Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.","All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.","It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.","Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.","Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?","Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city.","Anyone who is among the living has hope--even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!","The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.","By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.","Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.
