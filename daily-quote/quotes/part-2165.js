var author2165 = "Fancies", quotes2165 = ["Some things are of that nature as to makeOne's fancy chuckle, while his heart doth ache.","While fancy, like the finger of a clock,Runs the great circuit, and is still at home.","Pacing through the forest,Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy.","So full of shapes is fancy,That it alone is high fantastical.","Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!","Fancy light from Fancy caught.","Ever let the Fancy roam,Pleasure never is at home.","The truant Fancy was a wanderer ever.","Two meanings have our lightest fantasies,One of the flesh, and of the spirit one.","She's all my fancy painted her,She's lovely, she's divine.","When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away."]
