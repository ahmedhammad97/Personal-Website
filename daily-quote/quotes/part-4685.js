Love always wins.","Love each other or perish.","Love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone.","Don't hang on too long, but don't let go too soon.","Without love, we are birds with broken wings.","Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?","If the culture doesn't work, don't buy it.","If we can remember the feeling of love we once had, we can die without ever going away.","What is it about silence that makes people uneasy?","Fairness doesn't govern life and death.
