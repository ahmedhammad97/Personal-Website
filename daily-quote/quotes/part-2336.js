var author2336 = "Frederick William Faber", quotes2336 = ["The world is growing old;Where love is never cold?","The sea, unmated creature, tired and lone,Makes on its desolate sands eternal moan.","Labour itself is but a sorrowful song,The protest of the weak against the strong.","Holiness is an unselfing of ourselves.","Kindness has converted more sinners than either zeal, eloquence, or learning."]
