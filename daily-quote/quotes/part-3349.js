var author3349 = "Jean-Jacques Rousseau", quotes3349 = ["All that time is lost which might be better employed.","An honest man nearly always thinks justly.","A country cannot subsist well without liberty, nor liberty without virtue.","What good would it be to possess the whole universe if one were its only survivor?","It is too difficult to think nobly when one thinks only of earning a living.","Hatred, as well as love, renders its votaries credulous.","The thirst after happiness is never extinguished in the heart of man.","He thinks like a philosopher, but governs like a king.","It is unfortunate for J.J that Rousseau cannot say everything he knows about him."]
