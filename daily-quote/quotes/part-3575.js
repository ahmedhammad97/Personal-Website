var author3575 = "John Hoole", quotes3575 = ["Love what we see can from our sight remove,And things invisible are seen by Love.","What has that wretched damsel left to boast,What good on earth, whose virtuous praise is lost?","Reflect, ye gentle dames, that much they know,Who gain experience from another's woe.","What more our folly shows,Than while we others seek, ourselves to lose?","In blaming others, fools their folly show,And most attempt to speak when least they know.","For oft the graceOf costly vest improves a beauteous face.","Of all the sex this certain truth is known,No woman yet was ever content with one.","To others never doThat which yourselves would wish undone to you.","Never let us utter what we never can know,And chiefly when it works another's woe.","But such their power who rule with tyrant sway,Whom most they loath the people most obey.","When Fame, O monarch! good or evil tells,Evil or good beyond the truth she swells.","And Neptune's white herds low above the wave.","These friendly words awhile consoled the fair;For grief imparted oft alleviates care.","The toils of honour dignify repose.","'Tis often constancy to change the mind.","For while the treason I detest,The traitor still I love."]
